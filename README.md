This project uses a large dataset of movies and from that dataset it retrieves the information . It uses a probability function to take any random movie with the given input genre and recommends the movie with some brief description . 

The aim of this project is to make a chatbot that uses Machine learning concepts to recommend the movies and take the data directly from an api server . 

feel free to contribute on this project and add new features to it so we can build the desired project.
